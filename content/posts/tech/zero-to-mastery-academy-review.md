While I was looking for a way to learn web development, I found many resources to try. I wanted to go the free route first so I tried [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project") first. I liked the structure of it and the cool projects, felt like I learned better with videos instead of text. The Odin Project is a great resource and I may go back to revisit it, but I needed a different format to learn faster. I abandoned The Odin Project to search for a well structured video course. All of my searches kept coming back with [The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/ "The Compete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery") in the list of good courses. It was 2019 when I first purchased this program through Udemy and started going through it. Then life happened and it fell by the wayside for a couple years. When I finally had time to dedicate to it, I discovered the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/ "Zero to Mastery Academy").

It was a subscription to all of their courses and a discord community. There was a lot of courses I was interested in and enjoyed the format and projects from my first attempt at the web developer course so I wanted to signup. They had a sale going on for a lifetime membership that I figured would be worth it so I bought it. The discord allows you to find other students that are taking the same courses and start a study group. The group helps keeps you accountable and can help you if you get stuck on something. You're also encouraged to help other students since that's a good way to test what you know. The Discord community also helps critique your resume and portfolio site to make you stand out while job hunting. There are monthly coding challenges to put your skills to the test that are quite fun. Currently they have over 30 courses on different languages and frameworks.

On top of all the courses, they have workshops to help with interviewing and advancing your career. They also have life skills courses to help you keep a balanced, healthy life. They have programs on meditation, learning, achieving the life you want, and personal online security. There's cheatsheets for different languages and frameworks so you have a quick reference guide when you need it. My favorite feature is one they recently released. It's called Career Paths. You can answer a few questions and it will give you a structured curriculum to follow to reach your goal. You can also select a Career Path that you like and follow that. These layout when to take certain courses or workshops and when to start applying to jobs. They also point you to some of their blog posts to give you advice along the way.

I'm wrapping up my third course now, Complete Ethical Hacking Bootcamp 2022: Zero to Mastery. I'll be taking the Web Security & Bug Bounty course next. I've completed the Complete Web Developer and Complete Python Developer courses as well. I'll be writing reviews on the individual courses too. I used what I learned to create this site to showcase my new skills. If you want to be a developer I highly recommend the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io "Zero to Mastery Academy").
